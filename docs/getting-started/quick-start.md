# Quick Start

This guide should allow you to run kbase-ui on your host system. For more advanced developer or deployment scenarios, consult ...

## Prerequisites

Read the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) guide to ensure your host machine is up to snuff.

## macOS

1. A kbase-ui project requires a dedicated directory, into which you will clone the repos you are working with.
2. open a terminal into this folder, either the built-in _Terminal_ program, _iTerm_, or your terminal app of choice.
3. Clone the _kbase/kbase-ui_ repo into this folder:
   ```bash
   git clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui
   ```
4. Create and launch the kbase-ui image:

   ```bash
   make dev-start
   ```

5. Since that container is now running in the terminal, you'll need to open a new terminal window.
6. Point _ci.kbase.us_ to your local computer:

   Edit

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/hosts
   ```

   adding the line

   ```bash
   127.0.0.1	ci.kbase.us
   ```

   at the end of the file, then save it `[Shift][Z][Z]`

7. Open a browser to [https://ci.kbase.us](https://ci.kbase.us)
8. Since the proxy uses a _self-signed certificate_ to support https, your browser will likely complain. If your browser allow you to continue past the warning prompts, you can skip step 9.[^2]
9. If needed, sign the proxy certificate with a local certificate authorirty.
   - Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and [certutil](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/tools/NSS_Tools_certutil)
     ```bash
     brew install mkcert nss
     ```
   - Add the mkcert authority to your trust store
     ```bash
     mkcert -install
     ```
   - Generate a certificate
     ```bash
     make dev-cert
     ```
   - Relaunch & rebuild KBase-ui images
     ```bash
     make dev-stop
     docker rmi kbase/kbase-ui:dev_build kbase/kbase-ui-proxy:dev
     make dev-start
     ```
   - If your browser uses DNS-over-HTTPS (such as some Firefox installs), you will need to disable it for [https://ci.kbase.us](https://ci.kbase.us)
     - In Firefox, you can go to [about:config](about:config), add `ci.kbase.us` to the `network.trr.excluded-domains` setting, then restart the browser.
10. You should now see kbase-ui at [https://ci.kbase.us](https://ci.kbase.us) ðŸ˜Š
11. When done, you can simply press `[Control][C]` in the original terminal window to stop the containers.[^3]
12. If you won't be conducting further builds for this instance, you'll want to clear out the intermediate build image:[^4]

    ```bash
    make dev-clean
    ```

[^1]: If you use Terminal or iTerm, pressing `[Cmd][T]` will open a new tab in the terminal window, with the same directory.
[^2]: If your browser hangs when attempting to connect, you should have better luck using the private mode of your browser. Both Safari and Chrome work fine in private mode with self-signed certs, Firefox will still hang.
[^3]: Currently docker-compose does not always clean up after itself when using `[Control][C]` to stop it; see [this github issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3317).
[^4]: This also removes the Docker network "kbase-dev" created during image-building process.
