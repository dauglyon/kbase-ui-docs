# Quick Start

This guide should allow you to run kbase-ui on your host system. For more advanced developer or deployment scenarios, consult ...

## Prerequisites

Read the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) guide to ensure your host machine is up to snuff.

## macOS

1. A kbase-ui project requires a dedicated directory, into which you will clone the repos you are working with.
2. open a terminal into this folder, either the built-in _Terminal_ program, _iTerm_, or your terminal app of choice.
3. Clone the _kbase/kbase-ui_ repo into this folder:
   ```bash
   git clone -b develop https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui
   ```
4. Create and launch the kbase-ui image:

   ```bash
   make dev-start
   ```

5. Since that container is now running in the terminal, you'll need to open a new terminal window.
6. Point _ci.kbase.us_ to your local computer:

   Edit

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/hosts
   ```

   adding the line

   ```bash
   127.0.0.1	ci.kbase.us
   ```

   at the end of the file, then save it `[Shift][Z][Z]`

7. Open a browser to [https://ci.kbase.us](https://ci.kbase.us)
8. Since the proxy uses a _self-signed certificate_ to support https, your browser will likely complain. Just suffer through the prompts to allow the connection to proceed.[^2]
9. You should now see kbase-ui ðŸ˜Š
10. When done, you can simply press `[Control][C]` in the original terminal window to stop the containers.[^3]
11. If you won't be conducting further builds for this instance, you'll want to clear out the intermediate build image:[^4]

    ```bash
    make dev-clean
    ```

[^1]: If you use Terminal or iTerm, pressing `[Cmd][T]` will open a new tab in the terminal window, with the same directory.
[^2]: If your browser hangs when attempting to connect, you should have better luck using the private mode of your browser. Both Safari and Chrome work fine in private mode with self-signed certs, Firefox will still hang.
[^3]: Currently docker-compose does not always clean up after itself when using `[Control][C]` to stop it; see [this github issue](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3317).
[^4]: This also removes the Docker network "kbase-dev" created during image-building process.
