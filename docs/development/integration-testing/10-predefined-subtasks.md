# Predefined Subtasks

Subtasks are simply isolated sequences of test tasks. They are defined either in separate files or within a test file. They are used within test cases simply by referencing the name of the subtask. The name of the subtask is the base name of the file, for those defined in files, or the property key, if defined in a test.
