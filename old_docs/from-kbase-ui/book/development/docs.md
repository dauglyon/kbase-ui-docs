### Local Docs

- ensure you have the relatively current versions of following software installed (if you are curious about the versions supported, see the Dockerfile for versions used in the build):
    - nodejs and npm
    - git
    - make
- clone the repo
    - ```git clone https://gitub.com/kbase/kbase-ui```
- from the repo directory:
    - ```make docs-viewer```
- this will build the documentation and launch your system default browser with the docs.
