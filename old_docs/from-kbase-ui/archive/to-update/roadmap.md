# A single page app for testing work on the Euk Support Sprint

This work is actually developing into a new KBase SPA.

## Milestones, past, present, future.

### 0.1.0

Build the system. The system may operate in a partial manner. For instance, it may operate directly from the source directory, or not render the entire UI.

### 0.2.0

Operational system. The system will be more-or-less in its final shape, as far as physical structure (files and directories) and the UI (all built-in components displaying and working).

In addition, system building tools, such as Bower and NPM will be fully configured and happy (all required and recommended components in place, such as readme, repository, license, etc. files and settings.)

### 0.3.0

Dev environment operational. The dev environment allows a user to clone the repo, and with simple instructions build an environment suitable for hacking.

### 0.4.0

Production environment operational. Similar to the dev environment, the production environment can be built with simple instructions and started up without failure.

### 0.5.0

Documentation and testing to 50% coverage.

### 0.6.0

Documentation and testing to 100% coverage. 

### 0.7.0

Code review and release to CI

### 0.8.0

Beta level code cycle

### 0.9.0

Preview release level code cycle

### 1.0.0

Production release level code cycle.
