# Development Setup

## Prerequisites

- VirtualBox
  - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Vagrant
  - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
- Vagrant virtualbox guest update plugin (optional)
  - https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest
- git
  - git is included with Apple's Xcode command line tools, directly from git folks https://git-scm.com/download/mac, or with mac package managers like macports or brew.

## Assumptions

- working on a plugin that is already configured into the kbase-ui, either the dev or prod build (or both.)

## Get Repos

In a dedicated directory clone the following repos

- https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui
- https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-YOUR-PLUGIN

```
mkdir dev
cd dev
git clone -b develop ssh://git@github.com/your-github-account/kbase-ui
git clone ssh://git@github.com/your-github-account/kbase-ui-plugin-YOUR-PLUGIN
```

> A git-based workflow is a bit easier if you use an ssh public key in your github account; this is enabled via the ssh: url format.

## Set up Vagrant

## Create and set up an VM for Ubuntu 14.04 via Vagrant

### Initialize Vagrant:

```
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
```

### Set up Vagrant

Edit the ```Vagrantfile``` to set it up for better local development:

```text
config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
# comment after fixing /etc/exports
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs", nfs_udp: false, nfs_version: 3, nfs_export: true
# uncomment after fixing /etc/exports
# config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs", nfs_udp: false, nfs_version: 3, nfs_export: false
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  vb.memory = "1024"
  vb.customize ["setextradata", :id, "VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/vagrant", "1"]
end
```

You can place this anywhere in the file. I usually disperse these where they occur in the Vagrantfile, but they can also be inserted as a lump, for example, at the end of the file just before the final "end".vagr

This:

- creates a network interface to your VM, so that you can connect to services running in side it
- uses the ```nfs``` file system for mounting the shared folder inside the vm (which is located inside it at /vagrant)
- sets the memory to a reasonable minimum
- enables the usage of symlinking in shared folders

> You may wish to use a static ip rather than dhcp, in which case the following would apply, where you must obtain the ip from your host configuration.

```text
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "1.2.3.4"
```

> You may wish to simply copy the Vagrantfile from the docs/examples directory; it is very similar to the one above, but provides more resources to enable deploying a service inside the vm.

The funny business with NFS is required to allow symbolic linking within the vm using shared folders. The linking is a necessary part of the workflow for kbase-ui plugins.

### Set up the VM

```
vagrant up
```

When vagrant prompts for your password, enter the password for your local host account (assuming it is an Admin account.) Vagrant needs this in order to edit your nfs /etc/exports file (more on that later.)

```
vagrant ssh
sudo su
add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get dist-upgrade -y
apt-get autoremove -y
apt-get install nginx-extras -y
apt-get install nginx -y
```

> Note: If you received an NFS error when first starting up VM with "vagrant up", you can ignore the error message for now and proceed with the setup. The step below, "Fix the NFS configuration" will take care of this.

> Note that as you start up the vagrant-managed vm you will be asked for your password. This is your Mac password, assuming you are an Admin user. This is required for vagrant to update your local Mac nfs configuration.

### Determine the IP of the VM and set up a local host mapping

Still within the VM, obtain the IP address assigned via DHCP and then back on the host add it to the /etc/hosts file.

```
ifconfig | grep "inet addr:"
```

You'll need to hunt in the output for a line which is not using a private ip. E.g. in the following output 10.0.2.15 and 127.0.0.1 are both private IPs, so 172.28.128.3 is the one we want.

```
          inet addr:10.0.2.15  Bcast:10.0.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet addr:172.28.128.3  Bcast:172.28.128.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
```          

Open a new terminal window, edit the /etc/hosts file on your Mac host:

```
exit
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

add a line somewhere, e.g. at the bottom, like:

```
1.2.3.4 ci.kbase.us
```

We will be mapping ci.kbase.us into the VM, and inside the VM using an nginx config to map service requests to the real ci.

> Note that when you need to access the "real" ci.kbase.us you will need to disable this line in your /etc/hosts file.

### Fix the NFS configuration

At present, a bug in Vagrant causes it to tend to grab the wrong ip address from inside the VM and insert it into the host nfs exports file, which provides the nfs directory sharing.

If Vagrant does this, the nfs integration will fail, although the VM itself will start and be available via ssh.

To fix this we need to:

1. start vagrant once with the configuration above
2. get the ip address of the vm
3. ensure that the host's /etc/exports file contains the correct ip address
  - if not, correct it
4. disable nfs exports file writing

1 and 2. You should have already done steps 1 and 2 above.

3. Inspect the host's /etc/exports file

When vagrant detects nfs file sharing, it will create the mappings between the VM and host system in the host's /etc/exports file.

First open /etc/exports back on your host (mac) system

```
sudo vi /etc/exports
```

You should see an entry for the virtual machine.

Each entry is wrapped in comments provided by Vagrant which contain the vm's id. You can identify your section by the mappings that are shown. You can also identify the section by the vm's id, but that is not covered here [yet].

We are interested in the second value in the export entry, the ip address. If the value is not the same you you noted above, edit the ip address to correct it. If it is the same, simply leave it alone. If there are multiple lines in the section, check and correct each one.

When you have saved and exited the file, you'll need to adjust the Vagrantfile:

```
vi Vagrantfile
```

Comment out the line ending in ```nfs_export: true```, and uncomment the one ending in ```nfs_export: false```.

Before: 

```
# comment after fixing /etc/exports
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs", nfs_udp: false, nfs_version: 3, nfs_export: true
# uncomment after fixing /etc/exports
# config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs", nfs_udp: false, nfs_version: 3, nfs_export: false
```

After: 

```
# comment after fixing /etc/exports
# config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs", nfs_udp: false, nfs_version: 3, nfs_export: true
# uncomment after fixing /etc/exports
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "nfs", nfs_udp: false, nfs_version: 3, nfs_export: false
```

Restart vagrant to ensure that it starts error-free:

``` 
vagrant reload 
```

You may be pleased to learn that you will no longer be required to enter your host password upon vagrant startup.

## Set up Nginx 

Back in the VM we'll be setting up nginx.

``` 
vagrant ssh
```

### Install self signed cert

All services are typically operated over https, so we set up even the development environment for https. For local development a self-signed certificate is adequate, even if it does cause the browser to complain.

```
cd /vagrant
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout test.key -out test.crt
```

Openssl will prompt for certificate information. It doesn't really matter what you enter here:

```text
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Berkeley
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:LBNL
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:KBase
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:ci.kbase.us
Email Address []:
```

### Install the Nginx config

Edit the main nginx config file. Nginx installs with a single example, functional config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default. config files in /etc/nginx/sites-available are symlinked into /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. Thus to disable a config temporarily, remove the symlinked version in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled, and symlink it back later. In any case, we always edit the one in sites-available.

We are going to edit that file, erase the contents, and insert our config. E.g.

```text
vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
:1,$d
i
```

copy this

```text
#
# A minimal proxying configuration for running kbase-ui through a secure proxy
# against ci.
# 
# It is designed to operate inside a VM which naturally routes ci.kbase.us to its
# real location, while the host has ci mapped to the vm via /etc/hosts.
#

# Route insecure requests to secure.
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  server_name ci.kbase.us;
  return 301 https://ci.kbase.us$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name ci.kbase.us;
  ssl_certificate /vagrant/test.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /vagrant/test.key;
  
  # Proxy all service calls, including auth2, to the real CI
  location /services {
    # The cookie path rewriting is just for auth2
    proxy_cookie_path /login /services/auth/login;
    proxy_cookie_path /link /services/auth/link;
    proxy_pass https://ci.kbase.us/services;
    client_max_body_size 300M;
  }

  # Needed for dynamic service calls
  location /dynserv {
    proxy_pass https://ci.kbase.us/dynserv;
  }

  # Needed for running narratives
  location /narrative {
    proxy_pass https://ci.kbase.us/narrative;
    # Uncomment the following lines for a narrative deployed
    # within the proxy's vm.
    #proxy_pass http://localhost:8888/narrative;

    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Origin http://localhost;
    proxy_set_header Host localhost;
  }

  # Proxy all non-services to the local kbase-ui running in the vm
  location / {
    # next line for node testing server.
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/css application/json application/javascript;
    
    root /vagrant/kbase-ui/build/build/client;

    # Uncomment to work against the minified dist build.
    # root /vagrant/kbase-ui/build/build/client;

    index index.html;
  }

  # We need to proxy RESKE search, since the dev service is insecure.
  location /services/reske {
	proxy_pass http://dev01.kbase.lbl.gov:29999;

    # Enable for RESKE deployed inside the proxy's vm.
    # proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
  }
}
```

paste into the terminal running vi, then save and exit.

```text
<esc>
ZZ
```

Now we need to restart the virtual machine in order to map the directories and enable the other changes we made to Vagrantfile.

Exit back to the host, and reload vagrant.

```
exit
exit
vagrant reload
```

The first time reloading the virtual machine may take a while, as the system update may force a rebuild of the virtual box guest additions.

### Test it

The server should be set up enough to verify that it will build. Note that we do not yet have an instance of kbase-ui running, but the configuration is complete enough to test.

First enter the virtual machine:

```
vagrant ssh
```

Then test the ngninx configuration:

```text
sudo nginx -t
```

if all goes well

```text
service nginx start
```

## Set up kbase-ui

This is a host-based development workflow, so we'll set up kbase-ui on the host side. (We'll need to dip back over to the server to perform one more task later.)

Exit out of vagrant

```text
exit
```

### Build and set up kbase-ui

In the kbase-ui repo, build it:

```text
cd kbase-ui
make init
make build
```

Confirm quickly that the base build is working by visiting https://ci.kbase.us.

> Note - your browser will give you a security warning, due to the usage of the self-signed certificate. Each browser is different, but it should provide you with a way to bypass the error or add a security exception.

Assuming all has gone well...

Now we'll need to set up the linking script, by copying it from config/link.sh to dev/test/link.sh

```text
cp config/link.sh dev/test/link.sh
```

The dev/test directory is ignored by git, so is a safe place to stash develop-time assets. The link script is merely a convenience to provide symbolic linking for various bits of the ui source into the built ui client, which is what is served by nginx.


Edit the link.sh script to link to the plugin. Open the link.sh script in your editor, and in the EXTERNAL PLUGINS section add this line:

```text
linkPlugin "my-plugin"
```

### Link the plugin

The linking for the plugin  must be done on the vagrant side.

So, back in the terminal window **logged into vagrant**, do this:

```text
cd /vagrant/kbase-ui/dev/test
sudo bash link.sh
```

> Note that you must issue the linking from within the VM. In these instructions the javascript building and testing occurs in the Mac host environment, and the linking in the Ubuntu vm. This is purely a nod to the convenience of local development with the requirement that linking be within the vm to satisfy nginx with nfs hosted directories.

You should just need to do this once per development effort. If for some reason you need to rebuild kbase-ui, the linking will need to be repeated.

### Verify

Pull up the kbase-ui web app again in the browser to ensure that the plugin works. You may want to make a quick minor change to the plugin and verify that the change appears in the ui.


## Fin

Now you should be ready to hack on the plugin.
