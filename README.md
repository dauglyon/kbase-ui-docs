## Usage

HOW TO GET STARTED and USE IT

## Install

This documentation is designed to be accessed at its home on Github, located at (https://kbaseIncubator.github.io/kbase-ui-docs).

You can view it locally as well:

### macOS

- Open a terminal into this repos top level directory
- install `bundler` if you don't already have it (it is a Ruby package.)

    ```bash
    gem install bundler
    ```

    > Note that this and other Ruby related commands will probably ask you to authorize installation. This is because the packages (gems) are being installed at the system level. Just go ahead and authorize - do not try to run these commands with `sudo`, as they are designed to be run as a regular user and only prompt for authorization when they need to.

- install dependencies required by github pages:

    ``` bash
    bundle install
    ```



- start the Jekyll server

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

- take your browser to https://localhost:4000.
